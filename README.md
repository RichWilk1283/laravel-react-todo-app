# To Do App: using Laravel, React & Postgresql.

A full stack web app to track To do tasks, across a daily, weekly & monthly time scale.

This app uses:

- Laravel.
- React (Vite)
- Inertia.
- HeroIcons.

Things I would like to add in the future:

- Change the React components for the to do elements to only re-render the component that has changed.
- Add a login feature to enable the app to track different users todo/tasks.
